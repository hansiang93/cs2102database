### Initial Commit for CS2102 db alpha project

app name: cs2102database

### Setup

initialise your setup by 
> $ npm install

### Initial run

> $ DEBUG=cs2102database:* npm start

or

> $ npm start

or

> $ node server.js

and

view the app on a browser at 
> http://localhost:3000/


The postgresql setup was based off of the following tutorial: 
> http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/

The schema name used for this project in testingDB.js within MySQL (to be changed to PostgreSQL) is
'cs2102'
This allows for a DB server to be used for the injection of databases

#### Start pgsl server
Create/start pgsl server at:
> postgres://localhost:5432/cs2102

Enter the development database name, password and user in a '.env' file in root in the following format:

> MAILGUN_USERNAME='postmaster@sandbox67c118365e564798a8864434e4b2a3cb.mailgun.org'
> MAILGUN_PASSWORD='ed49d942fd9e6c11208ee3aacb29df9d'
> 
> SESSION_SECRET='a5855bab6c2aa2c41b942ef96a061bb83fa607812ed328b7f3542a383d794b5d'
> 
> DB_HOST=localhost
> DB_USER=root
> DB_PASS=<<PASSWORD>>
> DB_DATABASE=<<NAME>>


This would allow for the independence of a SQL server running on the application desktop

Knex usage is optional. Read up on Knex here:
