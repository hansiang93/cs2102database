# Alpha App for CS2102

Project for CS2102, NUS School of Computing

## Mega Boilerplate App (Node.js)

Generated by http://megaboilerplate.com

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This app is for demostration purposes and not for deployment

### Database Schema

[Database and SQL commands for this project](docs/databaseSchema.md)

### Prerequisites

This app uses NodeJS. Install NodeJS via your terminal with 

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```
or on

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

### Setup

initialise your setup by running

```
$ npm install
```

### Initial run

```
$ DEBUG=cs2102database:* npm start

or

$ npm start

or

$ node server.js

```

and

view the app on a browser at 

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

The postgresql setup was based off of the following tutorial: 

```
http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/
```

### Start pgsl server
Create/start pgsl server at:

```
postgres://localhost:5432/cs2102
```

Enter the development database name, password and user in a '.env' file in root in the following format:

```
SESSION_SECRET='a5855bab6c2aa2c41b942ef96a061bb83fa607812ed328b7f3542a383d794b5d'

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=<<PASSWORD>>
DB_DATABASE=<<NAME>>
```

This would allow for the independence of a SQL server running on the application desktop

Knex usage is optional. Read up on Knex here:

```

```
